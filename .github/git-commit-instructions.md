# Git Commit Instructions

- Use Conventional Commits format
- Use English for all commit messages
- Follow the convention: `<type>: <short summary>`
    - Examples of `type`: content, source, fix, test, style, refactor
    - The `short summary` must be concise (max 72 characters)
- Use the present imperative (e.g., "add", "fix", "update", "remove")
- If necessary, add a detailed description after a blank line
- If a new file is created in the /topics directory, use `content` as the type
- If a new file is created in the /source directory, use `source` as the type

## Examples:
- `content: add introduction to programming concepts`
- `feat: add practice problems for loops`
- `source: fix code example syntax error`
- `style: fix formatting in chapter 1`
