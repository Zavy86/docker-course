# Docker Course

> A comprehensive course designed to teach you everything you need to know about Docker.

Docker is a powerful platform that enables developers to build, ship, and run applications in containers. 

This course provides a comprehensive guide to Docker, starting from its history and core concepts, and progressing
through practical steps for creating, managing, and optimizing containers.

Whether you are new to containerization or looking to deepen your understanding, you will find valuable insights and 
hands-on examples to help you master Docker for modern software development.


## Approach

To get the most out of this course, I recommend first watching all the videos on my YouTube channel for a complete
overview of all the covered topics...

Then, if you want to dive deeper, come here and reread all the topics, or just the ones you understood less, perhaps
experimenting with the various examples with the console in your hand.

You can find all the course videos on YouTube in the following
